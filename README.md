# Python Blackjack Game

## Overview
This is a simple console-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game allows you to play a two-player version of Blackjack against the computer. It includes core features like card drawing, score calculation, and handling game outcomes based on the player's and computer's scores.

## How to Play
- The game begins by dealing two cards each to the player and the computer.
- The player's cards and one of the computer's cards are displayed.
- The player can choose to draw another card or stop.
- If the player's score exceeds 21, they lose the game.
- The computer will automatically draw another card if its score is below 17.
- The game ends when either the player or the computer wins, loses, or if the game is a draw.

## Features
- Random card drawing from a standard deck (excluding face cards).
- Ace can be counted as either 11 or 1, depending on the situation.
- Simple game logic to handle wins, losses, and draws.

1. Clone this repository:
